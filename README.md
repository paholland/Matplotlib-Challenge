## Matplotlib Project (The Power of Plots)

    To generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study and a top-level summary of the study results. 
    The purpose of that anti-cancer pharmaceutical study was to compare the performance of company's drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

Summary Statistics (the notebook generates a summary data frame that contains all drug regiments, all summary statisrics (mean, median, variance, std. dev.)

Par Plots (two bar plots are successfully generated depicting the number of data points for each treatment regimen using both plotting methods (pandas.DataFrame.plot() and matplotlib.plot())

Pie Plots ( two bar plots are generated depicting the distribution of male versus female mice using both plotting methods (pandas.DataFrame.plot() and matplotlib.plot())

Quartiles, IQR and Outliers (calculated in the notebook quartiles, IQR, outlier boundaries, and all potential outliers for all four drug regimens)

Box Plots (a box and whisker plot is successfully generated for the final tumor volume, and meets the criteria: all four treatment regimens are on the sameplot and potential outlier data points have a sustom style and color)

Line Plots (a line plot is generated for the time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin)

Scatter Plots (a scatter plot is generated depicting mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomullin regimen

Correlation and Regression (the correlation coefficient is calculated for mouse weight versus average tumor volume; the linear regression model is calculated for mouse weight versus average tumor volume; the linear regression model has been plotted over the scatter plot depicting mouse weight versus average tumor volume)

Observations and Insights (three observations/insights about the data are provided)
